# Albertsworld.github.io
This is my first trial of making text based game with javascript and html5. All credits are writen on the credit.txt file.

all the songs, sound effect and picture are taken from OpenGameArt.org.

Run 'Albert's world' file with chrome to avoid any errors.

Sorry for the messy code,  the process of of me making the code looks better is on progress.
Will be uploaded when its done.

The game will contstantly be improved so it will be much more fun!

Thanks!
